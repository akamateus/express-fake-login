# Express Basics

## Fake Login

- Created a new Express app named `login-demo`. Created a Git repository for it and push it to GitHub.
- The app should allow the user to log in, but since we are not working with **state** or **databases** yet, it will only demonstrate the basic functionality, and won't be a complete solution.
- It should have a Login page, a Home page, an Error page, and a My Account page.
